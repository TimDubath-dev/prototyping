      <h2>The Foundation of the Modern Web</h2>
      <p>
        Web technologies have revolutionized how we communicate, learn, and
        conduct business. At their core, these technologies consist of three
        fundamental pillars that work together to create the interactive
        experiences we use every day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Three Pillars</h2>

      <h3>1. HTML - The Structure</h3>
      <p>
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the structural foundation of
        web pages. It defines the content hierarchy, semantic meaning, and basic
        layout of information. Think of HTML as the skeleton that gives shape to
        your content.
      </p>

      <h3>2. CSS - The Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) control the visual presentation and layout
        of web pages. From colors and fonts to complex animations and responsive
        layouts, CSS brings your content to life with beautiful, engaging
        designs.
      </p>

      <h3>3. JavaScript - The Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It
        enables user interactions, data manipulation, and real-time updates that
        make modern web applications feel responsive and engaging.
      </p>
